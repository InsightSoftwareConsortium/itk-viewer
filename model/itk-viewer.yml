      In the Actor Model mathematical of computation, an actor is a computational entity that,
      in response to a message it receives, can concurrently:

      - send a finite number of messages to other actors;
      - create a finite number of new actors;
      - designate the behavior to be used for the next message it receives.

      Supported messages are defined in the Event classes. The valid Events' for an Actor are defined
      defined by the `receives` relationship. To send an Event to an Actor, use the `send` method.

      Actors are typically implement as finite state machines.

      A viewer is an interface that allows users to view and interact with

      A viewport is a rectangular region of a viewer that displays a rendering of the scene.

  MultiscaleImage:
    abstract: true
    is_a: Actor
    description: >-
      A multiscale image is a multi-dimensional image, based on the OME-Zarr data model, often preprocessed,
      that supports efficient rendering at multiple resolutions.

  Renderer:
    abstract: true
    is_a: Actor
    description: >-
      A renderer is an actor that renders a scene to an in-memory RGB image for display in a viewport.

  Event:
    abstract: true
    description: >-
      An event is a message that can be sent to an actor. The actor can respond to the event
      by changing its state, sending messages to other actors, or creating new actors.
